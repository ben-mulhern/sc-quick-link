# sc-quick-link

Chrome extension for quickly accessing incident tickets on a particular issue management system. Simple type `sc` followed by the incident number, e.g. `sc 1001234`

v1.1 can now handle partial incident numbers, e.g. `sc 1234` would load incident INC-1001234. `sc 12345` would load incident INC-1012345.

v1.2 uses the new URL and can handle the INC- prefix. e.g. `sc INC-1001234`
